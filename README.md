# Vending Machine Controller

A robust Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation of a vending machine controller, designed for FPGA integration

## Overview 
* Employs Control Signal Based Design
* Accepts Multiple Coin Denominations
* Properly Increments and Decrements
* Dispenses Desired Item if Correct Amount was Inserted

## Key Features: 
* **Synchronus Design:** All logic is bound to a common clock
* **Input Pulsing & Debouncing:** All buttons and switches are debounced to ensure proper calculation
* **7-Segment Display:** Displays machine state and balance, all changes are displayed
